Am I an NPC or a live player? Find the other live players.

Speak what you truly feel, as those who mind don't matter, and those who matter don't mind. :)

Constantly remind yourself to think big. You're not thinking big enough. More.

If you try to soften your impact by not thinking big publicly, it'll bleed into your writings on paper. Then you'll stop thinking big inside your head too.

I will no longer dial down my natural intensity for fear of intimidating the ones around me. This is the one life.

Absolute standards vs relative standards
Most people compare themselves to those immediately around them (physically/online). This leads to having relative standards. The average man is fat, broke, and a complete NPC.
To reach high absolute standards, you need to be around other people with high standards for things you care about. Echo chambers are actually good in this sense. Build echo chambers filled with high ambition, mission focused, good people. Cut ties with low standard people, people who chase only clout, who play zero sum games.
